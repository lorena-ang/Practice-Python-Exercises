# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

while True:
    num = int(input('Enter a number to find all its divisors: '))
    print(str([n for n in range(1,num+1) if num%n==0]) + '\n')
